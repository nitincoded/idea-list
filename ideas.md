# Volunteer Job Board

Say you are visiting a city and are just so totally bored. What do you do? Hit up the volunteering scene, of course! It's a great way to get around town, meet people, and it's all in the process of doing good for the community.

# Blood Donor Registration

Register as a blood donor, submit a sample & look up the results, and read about the latest blood requirements at emergency wards closest to you.
