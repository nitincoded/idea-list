# Volunteer Job Board

Say you are visiting a city and are just so totally bored. What do you do? Hit up the volunteering scene, of course! It's a great way to get around town, meet people, and it's all in the process of doing good for the community.

# Blood Donor Registration

Register as a blood donor, submit a sample & look up the results, and read about the latest blood requirements at emergency wards closest to you.

# Food Truck Locator

Get a notification when a food truck event is happening near you. Filter out trucks that you don't want to follow.

# List browser

Display term-definition markdown lists in a master-detail layout app. The raw markdown would have a pound with the term on one line, followed by text that serves as the definition, much like this list! This would turn a lot of the md files on Github including this one into an app! It would be cool if it doesn't have a web crawler component to convert the md into JSON, but if it did, oh well, might as well hack something together now rather than just an idea that never gets implemented.
